TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND FOLLOW GENERAL PRACTICES WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THESE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE MANNER IN WHICH TO RECORD AND REPORT OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE THESE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY MAY CHANGE OVER TIME OR PROVE TO BE INACCURATE BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. AS SUCH, CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND/OR ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT, AND ALL POLICIES DESCRIBED IN PART II, ITEM 8, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, NOTE 1 (NOTE 1), SHOULD BE REVIEWED FOR A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS RECORDED AND REPORTED.

WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING THREE POLICIES AS BEING CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE, AND/OR COMPLEX ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND BECAUSE OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS WOULD BE REPORTED UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OR USING DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS. THESE POLICIES RELATE TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE VALUATION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT HAS USED THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO MAKE THE ESTIMATIONS OR JUDGMENTS NECESSARY TO VALUE THE RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL PERFORMANCE THAT DIFFERS FROM ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS AND FUTURE CHANGES IN THE KEY VARIABLES COULD CHANGE FUTURE VALUATIONS AND IMPACT NET INCOME. MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THE APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF THE AREAS WE VIEW AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES

— THE RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RESERVE THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB THOSE LOSSES. IN DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE, MANAGEMENT MAKES NUMEROUS JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES BASED ON CONTINUOUS REVIEW OF THE LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO, ESTIMATES OF CLIENT PERFORMANCE, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND DISPOSITION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL LOSS RATES AND EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. IN ASSESSING THESE FACTORS, MANAGEMENT BENEFITS FROM A LENGTHY ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE WITH CREDIT DECISIONS AND RELATED OUTCOMES. NONETHELESS, IF MANAGEMENT’S UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE TO BE INACCURATE, THE RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES WOULD HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED. OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY RELATED TO THE RESERVE IS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 UNDER THE HEADING “RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES.”

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

— WE USE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS TO RECORD CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, TRADING ACCOUNT SECURITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE, AND INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AT FAIR VALUE OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS ON A NONRECURRING BASIS. THESE NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TYPICALLY INVOLVE WRITE-DOWNS OF, OR SPECIFIC RESERVES AGAINST, INDIVIDUAL ASSETS. GAAP ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHIN THE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY USED IN THE MEASUREMENT ARE OBSERVABLE OR UNOBSERVABLE. OBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT MARKET-DRIVEN OR MARKET-BASED INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES, WHILE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT OUR ESTIMATES ABOUT MARKET DATA.

THE DEGREE OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INVOLVED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT TRADE ACTIVELY AND HAVE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, THERE IS MINIMAL SUBJECTIVITY INVOLVED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES AND DATA ARE NOT FULLY AVAILABLE, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF QUOTED PRICES OR OBSERVABLE DATA. FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCED LIQUIDITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR CHANGES IN SECONDARY MARKET ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS BECOMING UNAVAILABLE. THEREFORE, WHEN MARKET DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE USE VALUATION TECHNIQUES THAT REQUIRE MORE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO ESTIMATE THE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. FAIR VALUE IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 1 UNDER THE HEADING “FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS” AND IN NOTE 21, “FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.”

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS VALUATION

— WE RECOGNIZE AS ASSETS THE RIGHTS TO SERVICE MORTGAGE LOANS FOR OTHERS, KNOWN AS MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS), WHETHER THE SERVICING RIGHTS ARE ACQUIRED THROUGH PURCHASES OR THROUGH ORIGINATED LOANS. MSRS DO NOT TRADE IN AN ACTIVE OPEN MARKET WITH READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES. ALTHOUGH SALES OF MSRS DO OCCUR, THE PRECISE TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE. AS SUCH, THE VALUE OF MSRS IS ESTABLISHED AND VALUED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELING TECHNIQUES WHICH REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES REGARDING FUTURE NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ACTUAL AND EXPECTED MORTGAGE LOAN PREPAYMENT RATES, DISCOUNT RATES, SERVICING COSTS, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE ESTIMATED RATES OF MORTGAGE LOAN PREPAYMENTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS DRIVING THE VALUE OF MSRS. INCREASES IN MORTGAGE LOAN PREPAYMENTS REDUCE ESTIMATED FUTURE NET SERVICING CASH FLOWS BECAUSE THE LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING LOAN IS REDUCED. IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS, MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES (WHICH ARE USED TO DETERMINE PREPAYMENT RATES), AND DISCOUNT RATES ARE HELD CONSTANT OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PORTFOLIO. ESTIMATED MORTGAGE LOAN PREPAYMENT RATES ARE DERIVED FROM A THIRD-PARTY MODEL AND ADJUSTED TO REFLECT OUR ACTUAL PREPAYMENT EXPERIENCE. MSRS ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF AMORTIZED COST OR FAIR VALUE. THE VALUES OF THESE ASSETS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED AND READILY AVAILABLE MARKET PRICING DOES NOT EXIST. THE VALUATION OF MSRS IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 21, “FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.”

NET INTEREST INCOME

— OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF EARNINGS IS NET INTEREST INCOME, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INCOME ON EARNING ASSETS AND THE COST OF FUNDS SUPPORTING THOSE ASSETS. SIGNIFICANT CATEGORIES OF EARNING ASSETS ARE LOANS AND SECURITIES WHILE DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS REPRESENT THE MAJOR PORTION OF INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES. FOR PURPOSES OF THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, COMPARISON OF NET INTEREST INCOME IS DONE ON A TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS, WHICH PROVIDES A COMMON BASIS FOR COMPARING YIELDS ON EARNING ASSETS EXEMPT FROM FEDERAL INCOME TAXES TO THOSE WHICH ARE FULLY TAXABLE.

NET INTEREST MARGIN (THE RATIO OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO AVERAGE EARNING ASSETS) IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES AND CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNING ASSETS AND THE LIABILITIES THAT FUND THOSE ASSETS. NET INTEREST MARGIN ON A FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS WAS 3.60% IN

2015

, COMPARED TO 3.59% IN

2014

AND 3.67% IN

2013

. TAX-EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME FOR

2014

WAS UP $3.53 MILLION FROM THE $158.64 MILLION REPORTED FOR

2013.

DURING

2015

, AVERAGE EARNING ASSETS INCREASED $155.18 MILLION WHILE AVERAGE INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES INCREASED $64.35 MILLION OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN

2014

. THE YIELD ON AVERAGE EARNING ASSETS DECREASED 1 BASIS POINT TO 3.99% FOR

2015

FROM 4.00% FOR

2014

DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN LOAN AND INVESTMENT YIELDS. LOAN AND LEASE NET INTEREST RECOVERIES OF $3.97 MILLION IN

2015

, $1.59 MILLION IN

2014

, AND $3.88 MILLION IN

2013

HELPED OFFSET CONTINUED PRESSURE IN THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. TOTAL COST OF AVERAGE INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES DECREASED 2 BASIS POINTS TO 0.52% DURING

2015

FROM 0.54% IN

2014

AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE RESULT WAS AN INCREASE OF 1 BASIS POINT TO NET INTEREST SPREAD, OR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTEREST INCOME ON EARNING ASSETS AND EXPENSE ON INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES.

THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DECREASE IN THE YIELD ON AVERAGE EARNING ASSETS IN

2015

WAS THE 3 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO YIELD. AVERAGE NET LOANS AND LEASES INCREASED $197.16 MILLION OR 5.42% IN

2015

FROM

2014

WHILE THE YIELD DECREASED TO 4.39%.

DURING

2015

, THE TAX-EQUIVALENT YIELD ON SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DECREASED 10 BASIS POINTS TO 2.08% WHILE THE AVERAGE BALANCE DECREASED $35.04 MILLION. AVERAGE MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE DECREASED $0.04 MILLION DURING

2015

AND THE YIELD DECREASED 19 BASIS POINTS. AVERAGE OTHER INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, TIME DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK EXCESS BALANCES, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB) STOCK AND COMMERCIAL PAPER DECREASED $6.90 MILLION DURING

2015

WHILE THE YIELD INCREASED 46 BASIS POINTS. THE INCREASE IN YIELD WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF LOWER OUTSTANDING BALANCES AT HIGHER RATES.

AVERAGE INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS INCREASED $91.30 MILLION DURING

2015

WHILE THE EFFECTIVE RATE PAID ON THOSE DEPOSITS DECREASED 1 BASIS POINT. AVERAGE NONINTEREST-BEARING DEMAND DEPOSITS INCREASED $92.02 MILLION DURING

2015.

AVERAGE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS DECREASED $26.44 MILLION DURING

2015

WHILE THE EFFECTIVE RATE PAID DECREASED 1 BASIS POINT. AVERAGE LONG-TERM DEBT DECREASED $0.51 MILLION DURING

2015

AS THE EFFECTIVE RATE DECREASED 21 BASIS POINTS. THE DECREASE IN EFFECTIVE RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATES ON MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SECURITIES IN 2014.

DECEMBER 31, 2014

. ALTHOUGH 1ST SOURCE BANK IS PARTICIPATING IN THE U.S. TREASURY MAKING HOME AFFORDABLE PROGRAMS, WE DO NOT FEEL IT HAS A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

1ST SOURCE BANK SELLS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS TO FANNIE MAE AS WELL AS FHA-INSURED AND VA-GUARANTEED LOANS IN GINNIE MAE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE SOLD LOANS ON A SERVICE RELEASED BASIS TO VARIOUS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN RECENT YEARS. THE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH WE SELL THESE MORTGAGE LOANS CONTAIN VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF LOANS FOR PURCHASE. ON OCCASION, WE MAY BE ASKED TO INDEMNIFY THE LOAN PURCHASER FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS THAT WERE LATER DEEMED INELIGIBLE FOR PURCHASE OR WE MAY BE ASKED TO REPURCHASE A LOAN. BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “REPURCHASES.” WITHIN THE INDUSTRY, REPURCHASE DEMANDS HAD BEEN INCREASING DURING PRIOR YEARS BUT DID SLOW DURING 2014 AND CONTINUED TO DECREASE IN 2015. WHILE WE BELIEVE THE LOANS WE HAVE UNDERWRITTEN AND SOLD TO THESE ENTITIES HAVE MET OR EXCEEDED APPLICABLE TRANSACTION PARAMETERS, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE TREND OF MORTGAGE INSURANCE RESCISSIONS AND SPECULATIVE REPURCHASE REQUESTS. OUR EXPOSURE RISK FOR REPURCHASES STARTS TO REDUCE IN 2016 AS A RESULT OF THE ENHANCEMENTS MADE BY FNMA IN 2013 TO THE SELLING REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES FRAMEWORK AS WARRANTIES ON LOANS SOLD AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH CHANGES LAPSE.

OUR LIABILITY FOR REPURCHASES, INCLUDED IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES ON THE STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, WAS $0.98 MILLION AND $1.72 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014

2015

COMPARED TO $(0.27) MILLION IN

2014

AND $1.99 MILLION IN

2013

. THE MORTGAGE REPURCHASE LIABILITY REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS THAT WE MAY INCUR. THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON SPECIFIC LOAN REPURCHASE REQUESTS AND A HISTORICAL LOSS RATIO WITH RESPECT TO ORIGINATION DOLLAR VOLUME. BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES IS DEPENDENT ON ECONOMIC FACTORS, INVESTOR DEMAND STRATEGIES AND OTHER EXTERNAL CONDITIONS THAT MAY CHANGE OVER THE LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS, THE LEVEL OF LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AND REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

CREDIT EXPERIENCE

RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES

— OUR RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES IS PROVIDED FOR BY DIRECT CHARGES TO OPERATIONS. LOSSES ON LOANS AND LEASES ARE CHARGED AGAINST THE RESERVE AND LIKEWISE, RECOVERIES DURING THE PERIOD FOR PRIOR LOSSES ARE CREDITED TO THE RESERVE. OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE RESERVE QUARTERLY, REVIEWING ALL LOANS AND LEASES OVER A FIXED-DOLLAR AMOUNT ($100,000) WHERE THE INTERNAL CREDIT QUALITY GRADE IS AT OR BELOW A PREDETERMINED CLASSIFICATION, ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED LOSS EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, AND OTHER PERTINENT FACTORS INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. DETERMINATION OF THE RESERVE IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE AS IT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL ON COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT IMPAIRED LOANS AND LEASES, ESTIMATED LOSSES ON POOLS OF HOMOGENEOUS LOANS AND LEASES BASED ON HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, AND CONSIDERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, PRINCIPALLY ECONOMIC RISK AND CONCENTRATION RISK, ALL OF WHICH MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT AND UNFORESEEN CHANGES. WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF THE LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO TO IDENTIFY BORROWERS THAT MIGHT DEVELOP FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN ORDER TO AID BORROWERS IN THE HANDLING OF THEIR ACCOUNTS AND TO MITIGATE LOSSES. SEE PART II, ITEM 8, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON MANAGEMENT’S EVALUATION OF THE RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSS METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY APPLIED FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WITH ENHANCEMENTS INSTITUTED PERIODICALLY. RESERVE RATIOS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY AND REVISED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT RECENT LOSS HISTORY AND TO INCORPORATE CURRENT RISKS AND TRENDS WHICH MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED IN HISTORICAL DATA. AS WE UPDATE OUR HISTORICAL CHARGE-OFF ANALYSIS, WE REVIEW THE LOOK-BACK PERIODS FOR EACH BUSINESS LOAN PORTFOLIO.

DURING 2015, THE MEDIUM-TERM PORTION OF THE LOOK-BACK PERIOD WAS SEVEN YEARS GIVEN THAT 2009 THROUGH 2015 LOSSES WERE CONSIDERABLY IMPACTED BY THE SEVERE RECESSION. ALTHOUGH THE RECESSION BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2007, ITS FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES WERE NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIOS UNTIL 2009. WE GAVE THE GREATEST WEIGHT TO THIS RECENT SEVEN YEAR PERIOD IN OUR CALCULATION, AS WE FEEL IT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS FOR 2016. FURTHERMORE, WE PERFORM A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF CHARGE-OFFS, NON-PERFORMING ASSET LEVELS, SPECIAL ATTENTION OUTSTANDINGS AND DELINQUENCY IN ORDER TO REVIEW PORTFOLIO TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING SPECIFIC INDUSTRY RISKS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RESERVES AND RESERVE RATIOS APPLIED TO VARIOUS PORTFOLIOS. WE ADJUST THE CALCULATED HISTORICAL BASED RATIO AS A RESULT OF OUR ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, PRINCIPALLY ECONOMIC RISK AND CONCENTRATION RISK. KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING OUR PORTFOLIOS ARE GROWTH IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, HOUSING MARKET TRENDS, COMMODITY PRICES, INFLATION AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES. CONCENTRATION RISK IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION IN NORTHERN INDIANA AND SOUTHWESTERN LOWER MICHIGAN IN OUR BUSINESS BANKING AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS AND BY COLLATERAL CONCENTRATION IN OUR SPECIALTY FINANCE PORTFOLIOS.

WEAKNESSES NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE U.S. RECOVERY, ARE GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS. CURRENT CONCERNS INCLUDE THE UNRELENTING DECLINE IN OIL PRICES, THE CONTINUED SLOWDOWN IN CHINA, THE WEAK EU ECONOMIES, THE RECESSIONARY PRESSURES IN JAPAN AND BRAZIL (WITH THE RESULTANT DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE REAL), THE GEOPOLITICAL THREATS TO THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC DECLINE DUE TO RUSSIA’S SIGNIFICANT DEPENDENCE ON OIL, AND THE HEIGHTENED CONCERNS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS. WE INCLUDE A FACTOR IN OUR LOSS RATIOS FOR GLOBAL RISK, AS WE ARE INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE THREAT THAT GLOBAL CONCERNS MAY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS. WHILE WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE WITH ANY PRECISION THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES ON 1ST SOURCE BANK’S LOAN PORTFOLIOS, WE FEEL THE RISKS ARE REAL AND SIGNIFICANT. WE BELIEVE THERE IS A RISK OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR BORROWERS THAT WOULD AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. THEREFORE, WE CONTINUE TO INCLUDE A FACTOR FOR GLOBAL RISK IN OUR ANALYSIS FOR 2015.

ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE OUR AIRCRAFT PORTFOLIO WHERE WE HAVE COLLATERAL CONCENTRATION AND $200 MILLION FOREIGN EXPOSURE. THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY WAS AMONG THE SECTORS AFFECTED MOST BY THE SLUGGISH ECONOMY. WE HAVE SEEN SOME EVIDENCE THAT DEPRESSED PRIVATE JET MARKETS HAVE STABILIZED. AS THE U.S. ECONOMY SLOWLY IMPROVES, THE INDUSTRY IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT AND WE SHOULD SEE A DECREASE IN THE FLEET OF UNSOLD PRE-OWNED AIRCRAFT WHICH WILL RESULT IN FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF VALUES. NEVERTHELESS, WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROLONGED LOW PRICES FOR SEVERAL MODELS. WE ALSO HAVE FOREIGN EXPOSURE IN THIS PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY IN MEXICO AND BRAZIL. THE RECESSION IN BRAZIL AND THE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ARE HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR CLIENTS’ COST OF PAYING DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBTS AND, AS A RESULT, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DELINQUENCY IN THIS PORTFOLIO AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE HIGHER DEFAULT RATES IN THIS PORTFOLIO THAN IN OUR OTHER LENDING SEGMENTS. WE REASSESSED OUR RATIOS, WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED BASED ON THE HIGHER AND MORE VOLATILE LOSS HISTORIES AND, NOTWITHSTANDING MORE RECENT CURRENCY FLUCTUATION, MADE A MODEST ADJUSTMENT TO OUR RESERVE RATIO FOR OUR AIRCRAFT PORTFOLIO WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE APPROPRIATE GIVEN OUR DISCIPLINED LOAN UNDERWRITING PRACTICES.

WE EXPERIENCED ONGOING IMPROVEMENT IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCK PORTFOLIO. WE RECOGNIZED SIZABLE LOSSES DURING 2009 AND THE FIRST HALF OF 2010; HOWEVER, SINCE THEN WE HAVE HAD NO CHARGE-OFFS. OUR CREDIT QUALITY IS STRONGEST WHEN INDUSTRY CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE. LOWER GAS PRICES AND GROWTH IN GDP, AND THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR, WHICH LEADS TO HIGHER DEMAND FOR TRUCKING BODE WELL FOR THE INDUSTRY. INDUSTRY CONCERNS INCLUDE A PERSISTENT DRIVER SHORTAGE, MEETING EMISSIONS STANDARDS AND ACHIEVING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. NEVERTHELESS, THE UNDERLYING INDUSTRY FUNDAMENTALS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE. AS A RESULT, WE MAINTAINED OUR RISK FACTORS AT LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH LAST YEAR.

OUR CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT PORTFOLIO IS CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASING OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCES AND CONTINUED STRONG CREDIT QUALITY IN 2015. THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, WHICH WAS HARD HIT DURING THE RECESSION, IS BENEFITING FROM AN IMPROVING ECONOMY, BUOYED BY GROWTH IN PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. THE BANK HAS LIMITED EXPOSURE TO THE INDUSTRY'S WEAKEST SECTOR, ENERGY, WHICH CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE AS A RESULT OF ONGOING DECLINES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES. HISTORICALLY, 1ST SOURCE HAS EXPERIENCED LESS VOLATILITY IN THIS PORTFOLIO THAN THE INDUSTRY AS LOSSES HAVE BEEN MITIGATED BY APPROPRIATE UNDERWRITING AND A GLOBAL MARKET FOR USED CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. WEAK GLOBAL DEMAND AND THE STRONG DOLLAR HELD DOWN USED EQUIPMENT EXPORTS, BUT THE U.S. MARKET REMAINS SOLID. THE UNDERLYING RISK HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THIS PORTFOLIO; OUR RESERVE FACTORS ARE SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR.

THE AUTO AND LIGHT TRUCK PORTFOLIO OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCES REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, WITH NORMAL SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS. USED CARS HELD THEIR VALUES IN 2015. INDUSTRY GROWTH IS PROJECTED TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASING RENTAL RATES, ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE SOME DAMPENING IN THE USED AUTO MARKET IN 2016. WE MADE A SLIGHT DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT TO THE RESERVE RATIO FOR THE AUTO PORTFOLIO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE ARE SEVERAL INDUSTRIES REPRESENTED IN THE COMMERCIAL AND AGRICULTURAL PORTFOLIO. THE OUTLOOK FOR THE BUSINESS BANKING PORTFOLIO IS GUARDEDLY OPTIMISTIC. WHILE RECENT ECONOMIC NEWS INDICATES MODEST IMPROVEMENT, EXEMPLIFIED BY LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCREASED CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, THE OVERALL DECLINES IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR ARE CONCERNING. FURTHERMORE, THE DECLINE IN COMMODITIES PRICES, PARTICULARLY CORN AND SOYBEANS, WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE CROP SECTOR OF OUR AGRICULTURE PORTFOLIO. WE ANTICIPATE SOME OF OUR BORROWERS WILL BE UNABLE TO REPAY THEIR LINES OF CREDIT IN FULL, RESULTING IN CARRY-OVER DEBT. OVERALL, WE ARE EXPERIENCING TRENDS OF GENERALLY IMPROVING CREDIT QUALITY, WITH LOW DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFFS. WE HAVE REVIEWED THE CALCULATED LOSS RATIOS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND CONCENTRATION ISSUES AFFECTING THESE PORTFOLIOS AND INCORPORATED MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RESERVE RATIOS AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE.

SIMILAR TO THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS ARE CONCENTRATED IN OUR LOCAL MARKET WITH LOCAL CUSTOMERS, WITH APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE BANK'S EXPOSURE BEING OWNER OCCUPIED FACILITIES WHERE WE ARE THE PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP BANK FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. NEVERTHELESS, WE WERE NOT IMMUNE TO THE DRAMATIC DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION, SIMILAR TO OTHER U.S. MARKETS AND WE EXPERIENCED LOSSES FROM 2009 THROUGH 2011. FURTHERMORE, OUR RECENT PORTFOLIO GROWTH HAS BEEN IN THE MORE RISKY NON-OWNER OCCUPIED SECTOR. OUR RECENT LOSS HISTORY IS FAVORABLE; HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF OUR GROWTH IN MORE RISKY SECTORS, WE REMAIN CAUTIOUS AND MADE ONLY A MODEST ADJUSTMENT TO THE RESERVE RATIO.

THE RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, TOTALED $88.11 MILLION AND WAS 2.21% OF LOANS AND LEASES, COMPARED TO $85.07 MILLION OR 2.31% OF LOANS AND LEASES AT

AND $83.51 MILLION OR 2.35% OF LOANS AND LEASES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

. IT IS OUR OPINION THAT THE RESERVE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES WAS APPROPRIATE TO ABSORB PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS

— NONPERFORMING ASSETS INCLUDE LOANS PAST DUE OVER 90 DAYS, NONACCRUAL LOANS, OTHER REAL ESTATE, REPOSSESSIONS AND OTHER NONPERFORMING ASSETS WE OWN. OUR POLICY IS TO DISCONTINUE THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST ON LOANS AND LEASES WHERE PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS PAST DUE AND REMAINS UNPAID FOR 90 DAYS OR MORE, OR WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF A BORROWER’S CREDIT WORTHINESS INDICATES A CREDIT SHOULD BE PLACED ON NONPERFORMING STATUS, EXCEPT FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, WHICH ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL AT THE TIME THE LOAN IS PLACED IN FORECLOSURE AND CONSUMER LOANS THAT ARE BOTH WELL SECURED AND IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $20.62 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, COMPARED TO $42.48 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, AND $46.75 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

. DURING

2015

, INTEREST INCOME ON NONACCRUAL LOANS AND LEASES WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.03 MILLION COMPARED TO $3.03 MILLION IN

2014

IF THESE LOANS AND LEASES HAD EARNED INTEREST AT THEIR FULL CONTRACTUAL RATE.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

DECREASED FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2014

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PURCHASED FUNDS

— WE USE PURCHASED FUNDS TO SUPPLEMENT CORE DEPOSITS, WHICH INCLUDE CERTAIN CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT OVER $250,000, BROKERED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, OVER-NIGHT BORROWINGS, SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. PURCHASED FUNDS ARE RAISED FROM CUSTOMERS SEEKING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND ARE USED TO MANAGE THE BANK’S INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY. DURING

2015

, OUR RELIANCE ON PURCHASED FUNDS INCREASED TO 9.79% OF AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS FROM 9.23% IN

2014.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

— AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY EQUATED TO 12.72% OF AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS IN

2015

, COMPARED TO 12.52% IN

2014

. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY WAS 12.41% OF TOTAL ASSETS AT YEAR-END

2015

, COMPARED TO 12.72% AT YEAR-END

2014

. WE INCLUDE UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, NET OF INCOME TAXES, IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY. WHILE REGULATORY CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS EXCLUDE UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES), IT DOES IMPACT OUR EQUITY AS REPORTED IN THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, NET OF INCOME TAXES, WERE $6.56 MILLION AND $9.41 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014

, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER LIQUIDITY

— UNDER INDIANA LAW GOVERNING THE COLLATERALIZATION OF PUBLIC FUND DEPOSITS, THE INDIANA BOARD OF DEPOSITORIES DETERMINES WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO PLEDGE COLLATERAL BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR FINANCIAL RATINGS. WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT NO COLLATERAL IS REQUIRED FOR OUR PUBLIC FUND DEPOSITS. HOWEVER, THE BOARD OF DEPOSITORIES COULD ALTER THIS REQUIREMENT IN THE FUTURE AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY EXPOSURE IF WE MUST PLEDGE COLLATERAL IS APPROXIMATELY $529 MILLION.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

— THE BANK’S LIQUIDITY IS MONITORED AND CLOSELY MANAGED BY THE ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (ALCO), WHOSE MEMBERS ARE COMPRISED OF THE BANK’S SENIOR MANAGEMENT. ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT INCLUDES THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY AND THE MAINTENANCE OF AN ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY POSITION. THE PURPOSE OF INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY MANAGEMENT IS TO STABILIZE NET INTEREST INCOME DURING PERIODS OF CHANGING INTEREST RATES.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE BANK ENSURES THAT ADEQUATE LIQUID FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS ON A TIMELY BASIS. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MUST MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY TO MEET DAY-TO-DAY REQUIREMENTS OF DEPOSITORS AND BORROWERS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDE A CUSHION AGAINST UNFORESEEN NEEDS.

LIQUIDITY OF THE BANK IS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM CORE DEPOSITS, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON LOANS, THE SALE AND MATURITY OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND ACCESS TO OTHER FUNDING SOURCES. THE MOST STABLE SOURCE OF LIABILITY-FUNDED LIQUIDITY IS DEPOSIT GROWTH AND RETENTION OF THE CORE DEPOSIT BASE. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF ASSET-FUNDED LIQUIDITY IS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES, CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, OVERNIGHT INVESTMENTS, SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL, AND LOANS AND INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS MATURING WITHIN ONE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, LIQUIDITY IS PROVIDED BY REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND THE ABILITY TO BORROW FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK (FRB) AND THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB).

THE BANK’S LIQUIDITY STRATEGY IS GUIDED BY INTERNAL POLICIES AND THE INTERAGENCY POLICY STATEMENT ON FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT. INTERNAL GUIDELINES CONSIST OF.

(I)

AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY (SUM OF SHORT TERM BORROWING CAPACITY) GREATER THAN $500 MILLION;

(II)

LIQUIDITY RATIO (TOTAL OF NET CASH, SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND UNPLEDGED MARKETABLE ASSETS DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF NET DEPOSITS AND SHORT TERM LIABILITIES) GREATER THAN 15%;

(III)

DEPENDENCY RATIO (NET POTENTIALLY VOLATILE LIABILITIES MINUS SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS DIVIDED BY TOTAL EARNING ASSETS MINUS SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS) LESS THAN 15%; AND

(IV)

LOANS TO DEPOSITS RATIO LESS THAN 100%

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREGOING INTERNAL POLICIES AND REGULATORY GUIDELINES.

THE BANK ALSO MAINTAINS A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN THAT ASSESSES THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS UNDER VARIOUS SCENARIOS OF MARKET CONDITIONS, ASSET GROWTH AND CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADES. THE PLAN INCLUDES LIQUIDITY STRESS TESTING WHICH MEASURES VARIOUS SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS UNDER THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THE CONTINGENCY PLAN PROVIDES FOR ONGOING MONITORING OF UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY AND AVAILABLE SOURCES OF CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY TO PREPARE FOR UNEXPECTED LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND TO COVER UNANTICIPATED EVENTS THAT COULD AFFECT LIQUIDITY.

WE HAVE BORROWING SOURCES AVAILABLE TO SUPPLEMENT DEPOSITS AND MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS. 1ST SOURCE BANK HAS ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH SEVERAL BANKS TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM BORROWINGS IN THE FORM OF FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED. WHILE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

THERE WAS NONE OUTSTANDING, WE COULD BORROW APPROXIMATELY $265.00 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR A SHORT TIME FROM THESE BANKS ON A COLLECTIVE BASIS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, WE HAD $128.04 MILLION OUTSTANDING IN FHLB ADVANCES AND COULD BORROW AN ADDITIONAL $356.08 MILLION. WE ALSO HAD $424.68 MILLION AVAILABLE TO BORROW FROM THE FRB WITH NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

— ALCO MONITORS AND MANAGES THE RELATIONSHIP OF EARNING ASSETS TO INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES AND THE RESPONSIVENESS OF ASSET YIELDS, INTEREST EXPENSE, AND INTEREST MARGINS TO CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE FACE ONGOING INTEREST RATE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE MAY UTILIZE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO PARTIALLY MANAGE THE PRIMARY MARKET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO UNDERLYING ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS.

A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME WAS MODELED BY CALCULATING AN IMMEDIATE 200 BASIS POINT (2.00%) AND 100 BASIS POINT (1.00%) INCREASE AND A 100 BASIS POINT (1.00%) DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE AGGREGATE HYPOTHETICAL IMPACT TO PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME.

THE EARNINGS SIMULATION MODEL EXCLUDES THE EARNINGS DYNAMICS RELATED TO HOW FEE INCOME AND NONINTEREST EXPENSE MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED. THE USE OF THIS METHODOLOGY TO QUANTIFY THE MARKET RISK OF THE BALANCE SHEET SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF ITS ACCURACY OR THE ACCURACY OF THE RELATED ASSUMPTIONS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014

, THE IMPACT OF THESE HYPOTHETICAL FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES ON OUR DERIVATIVE HOLDINGS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND, AS SUCH, SEPARATE DISCLOSURE IS NOT PRESENTED. WE MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO MORTGAGE LOAN COMMITMENTS BY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS FOR FUTURE DELIVERY OF LOANS WITH OUTSIDE PARTIES. SEE PART II, ITEM 8, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA — NOTE 18 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OPERATIONS, WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. SUCH OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE FUNDING OF OPERATIONS THROUGH DEBT ISSUANCES AS WELL AS LEASES FOR PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR SIGNIFICANT FIXED, DETERMINABLE, AND ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, BY PAYMENT DATE, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, EXCEPT FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-TERM BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS. PAYMENTS FOR BORROWINGS DO NOT INCLUDE INTEREST. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE NATURE OF EACH OBLIGATION IS INCLUDED IN THE REFERENCED NOTE TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES. THESE CONTRACTS MAY REQUIRE PAYMENT FOR SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED IN THE FUTURE AND MAY ALSO CONTAIN PENALTY CLAUSES FOR EARLY TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT. WE HAVE MADE A DILIGENT EFFORT TO ESTIMATE SUCH PAYMENTS AND PENALTIES, WHERE APPLICABLE. ADDITIONALLY, WHERE NECESSARY, WE HAVE MADE REASONABLE ESTIMATES AS TO CERTAIN PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS USED THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO MAKE THE ESTIMATIONS NECESSARY TO VALUE THE RELATED PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. OUR MANAGEMENT IS NOT AWARE OF ANY ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES AT YEAR-END

2015.

WE ALSO ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO EITHER RECEIVE CASH FROM, OR PAY CASH TO, COUNTERPARTIES DEPENDING ON CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH THE FAIR VALUE REPRESENTING THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH RECEIPTS OR PAYMENTS BASED ON MARKET INTEREST RATES AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS CHANGES DAILY AS MARKET INTEREST RATES CHANGE. BECAUSE THE DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY ULTIMATELY BE PAID UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PRESENTED ABOVE.
